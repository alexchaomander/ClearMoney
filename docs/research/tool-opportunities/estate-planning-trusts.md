# Tool Opportunities: Estate Planning & Trusts

## Overview

Estate planning is typically associated with the ultra-wealthy, but high-income tech and finance workers accumulate significant assets that require planning. The 2025-2026 window is particularly critical as estate tax exemptions are set to drop significantly in 2026.

## The Problem

### Procrastination
- Estate planning feels morbid and distant
- High earners are busy building wealth, not protecting it
- "I'll deal with it later" until it's too late
- Most people don't even have a basic will

### Complexity
- Trusts seem intimidating and "rich people only"
- State laws vary significantly
- Coordinating beneficiaries across accounts is confusing
- Tax implications are hard to model

### Timing Urgency
- Estate tax exemption: $13.99M per person in 2025
- Expected to drop to ~$6-7M in 2026
- Gifts made now lock in current exemption
- Planning takes time (can't rush at year-end)

## Key Concepts

### Estate Tax Basics
- **Federal exemption (2025):** $13.99M per person ($27.98M married)
- **Tax rate above exemption:** 40%
- **Sunset (2026):** Exemption drops to ~$6-7M
- **State estate taxes:** 12 states + DC have separate estate taxes

### Trust Types

#### Revocable Living Trust
- You maintain control during lifetime
- Avoids probate (privacy, speed)
- NO tax benefits (still in your estate)
- Good for: probate avoidance, privacy, incapacity planning

#### Irrevocable Trust
- You give up control
- Assets removed from taxable estate
- Potential gift tax implications
- Good for: estate tax reduction, asset protection

#### Grantor Retained Annuity Trust (GRAT)
- Transfer appreciating assets
- Receive annuity payments
- Appreciation passes to beneficiaries tax-free
- Good for: passing on growth of assets like pre-IPO stock

#### Intentionally Defective Grantor Trust (IDGT)
- Irrevocable for estate tax purposes
- Grantor still pays income taxes (allows tax-free growth)
- Commonly used for high-value transfers
- Good for: maximizing wealth transfer

#### Qualified Personal Residence Trust (QPRT)
- Transfer home at discounted value
- Continue living in it during trust term
- Good for: passing home to children tax-efficiently

#### Charitable Remainder Trust (CRT)
- Donate appreciated assets
- Receive income stream for life
- Remainder goes to charity
- Good for: capital gains avoidance + income + charitable giving
