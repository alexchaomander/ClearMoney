# Tool Opportunities: Charitable Giving Strategies

## Overview

Charitable giving is one of the most powerful tax tools available to high-income earners, yet most don't optimize it. Beyond the feel-good aspect, strategic giving can provide immediate tax deductions, avoid capital gains, and enable wealth transfer—all while supporting causes you care about.

## The Problem

### Missed Opportunities
- Donating cash when appreciated stock is available
- Not bunching donations in high-income years
- Giving directly when DAF would be better
- Ignoring Qualified Charitable Distributions (QCDs) after 70.5

### 2025-2026 Tax Changes
The One Big Beautiful Bill Act brings significant changes:
- **New 0.5% AGI floor** on charitable deductions (starting 2026)
- **35% cap on deduction value** for top earners (down from 37%)
- 2025 is the last year under more favorable rules
- Strategic giving in 2025 captures better tax treatment

### Complexity
- Different rules for cash vs appreciated assets
- DAF vs direct giving tradeoffs
- CRT structuring complexity
- AGI percentage limits vary by asset type

## Key Strategies

### 1. Donate Appreciated Stock (Not Cash)
- **Deduct full fair market value** (not cost basis)
- **Avoid capital gains tax** on appreciation
- **Double benefit:** Deduction + capital gains avoidance
- Must have held >1 year for full benefit

**Example:** Stock bought at $10K, now worth $100K
- Sell and donate cash: Pay ~$18K capital gains tax, donate $82K
- Donate stock directly: Donate $100K, deduct $100K, no capital gains

### 2. Donor-Advised Funds (DAFs)
- Contribute now, get immediate deduction
- Distribute to charities over time
- Investment growth is tax-free
- "Bunching" strategy enabler

### 3. Bunching Strategy
- Combine multiple years' donations into one year
- Exceed standard deduction threshold
- Take standard deduction in other years
- Especially powerful after TCJA increased standard deduction

### 4. Qualified Charitable Distributions (QCDs)
- Available after age 70.5
- Donate directly from IRA to charity
- Up to $105,000/year (2024)
- Counts toward RMD but not taxable income
- Better than taking RMD and donating

### 5. Charitable Remainder Trusts (CRTs)
- Donate appreciated assets to trust
- Receive income stream for life/term
- Remainder goes to charity
- Immediate partial deduction
- Capital gains deferral

## Tool Opportunities

### 1. Appreciated Asset Donation Calculator

**Problem:** People don't realize how much more valuable donating appreciated stock is versus cash.

**Features:**
- Input: Cost basis, current value, holding period
- Output: Tax savings comparison (cash vs stock)
- Capital gains avoided calculation
- Effective "cost" of donation
- Wash sale warning if planning to rebuy

**Key insight:** For highly appreciated assets, the "cost" of a $10K donation might only be $6K after tax benefits.

**Features:**
- Multi-year giving projection
- Standard vs itemized comparison each year
- Optimal bunching schedule

**Example:** Instead of $10K/year (below standard deduction), give $30K every 3 years (exceeds standard deduction in that year).
