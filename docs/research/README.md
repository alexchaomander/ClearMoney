# ClearMoney Research Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive research on personal finance influencers, their philosophies, and the tool opportunities we've identified for the ClearMoney platform.

## Purpose

This research serves as the foundation for building ClearMoney's suite of financial tools. By understanding the landscape of personal finance advice—both its strengths and weaknesses—we can create tools that:

1. **Fill gaps** in existing solutions
2. **Counter misinformation** with transparent, math-based alternatives
3. **Respect different philosophies** while providing objective analysis
4. **Empower users** to make informed decisions

### For Agent Prompts
Each app specification in `/docs/app-specs/` references this research. When building an app:
1. Read the "Inspired By" section in the app spec

3. Understand what makes our approach different

### For Content Creation
- Influencer profiles provide attribution for concepts we reference
- Tool opportunities contain content angles and educational value
- Competitive analysis shows gaps we can fill with content

## Key Insights Summary

### The Points Guy (TPG) - Our Primary Counter-Position
TPG represents the affiliate-driven content model we're countering. Their $50M+ revenue comes from credit card commissions, creating inherent conflicts of interest. Our tools provide transparent alternatives with open-source methodologies.

### Dave Ramsey - Behavioral Finance
"Personal finance is 20% head knowledge and 80% behavior." While we may disagree with some of his advice (like avoiding all credit cards), his insight about behavior driving financial success is crucial.

### Ramit Sethi - Conscious Spending
The concept of spending extravagantly on things you love while cutting mercilessly on things you don't informs our non-judgmental approach to financial tools.

### FIRE Movement - Mathematical Clarity
The shockingly simple math behind early retirement (savings rate determines years to retirement) demonstrates how clear financial math can be empowering.

## Research Methodology
