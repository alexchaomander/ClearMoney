## Key Insights Summary

### General Personal Finance

#### The Points Guy (TPG) - Our Primary Counter-Position
TPG represents the affiliate-driven content model we're countering. Their $50M+ revenue comes from credit card commissions, creating inherent conflicts of interest. Our tools provide transparent alternatives with open-source methodologies.

#### Dave Ramsey - Behavioral Finance
"Personal finance is 20% head knowledge and 80% behavior." While we may disagree with some of his advice (like avoiding all credit cards), his insight about behavior driving financial success is crucial.

#### Ramit Sethi - Conscious Spending
The concept of spending extravagantly on things you love while cutting mercilessly on things you don't informs our non-judgmental approach to financial tools.

#### FIRE Movement - Mathematical Clarity
The shockingly simple math behind early retirement (savings rate determines years to retirement) demonstrates how clear financial math can be empowering.

### High-Income & Tech-Focused (NEW)

#### Financial Samurai (Sam Dogen) - High Income Reality
Former Goldman Sachs banker who retired at 34 via negotiated severance. Key insight: "Stealth wealth" and living below means despite high income. Famous for controversial "$500K/year scraping by" post illustrating HCOL lifestyle inflation.

#### FAANG FIRE (Andre Nader) - Tech Worker FIRE
Ex-Meta employee who achieved FIRE after layoff. Provides authentic peer-to-peer advice for tech workers navigating RSUs, equity compensation, and the unique challenges of tech careers. Created free Total Compensation Dashboard.

#### White Coat Investor (James Dahle) - High-Income Professionals
Emergency physician who created the largest physician-focused finance site. Key insight: "The #1 threat to your financial plan is burnout." Applicable to all high-income, high-stress professions including tech.

#### Mad Fientist - Tax Optimization
Created breakthrough research on tax strategies for early retirees. Key discoveries: Traditional > Roth for early retirees (counterintuitive), HSA is the ultimate retirement account, Roth conversion ladder enables tax-free retirement.

#### Money Guy Show - Financial Order of Operations
Actual CFPs/CPAs who provide free advisor-quality content. Created the "Financial Order of Operations" framework for prioritizing financial decisions. Key insight: Save 25-30% of income for wealth building.

#### Secfi - Equity Compensation
Platform working with 80% of U.S. unicorns on equity compensation. Key data: Stock options = 86% of average startup employee's net worth. Provides critical education on ISOs, NSOs, 83(b) elections, and exercise strategies.

### Advanced Topics for High-Income Earners

#### Equity Compensation
RSUs, ISOs, NSOs, and ESPP are poorly understood by employees despite representing significant portions of compensation. Key strategies: 83(b) elections, early exercise, concentration risk management, QSBS benefits.

#### Tax Optimization
High earners face different landscape: phase-outs, AMT, NIIT. Key strategies: Backdoor Roth, Mega Backdoor Roth, tax-loss harvesting, Roth conversion ladder, HSA maximization.

#### Estate Planning (URGENT 2025)
Federal exemption at $13.99M drops to ~$6-7M in 2026. High-income earners need to act in 2025 to lock in current exemptions through trusts, GRATs, and gifting strategies.

#### Charitable Giving
2026 brings new AGI floors and caps on deductions. 2025 is strategic year to accelerate charitable giving through DAFs and appreciated stock donations.
