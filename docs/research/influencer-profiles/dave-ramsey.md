## The 7 Baby Steps

Dave Ramsey's famous framework for financial progress:

### Baby Step 1: $1,000 Starter Emergency Fund
Save $1,000 as fast as possible as a "starter" emergency fund before attacking debt.

### Baby Step 2: Pay Off All Debt (Debt Snowball)
List all debts smallest to largest. Pay minimums on everything except the smallest. Attack the smallest debt with all extra money. When it's paid off, roll that payment to the next smallest.

### Baby Step 3: 3-6 Months Emergency Fund
After debt-free, build a full emergency fund covering 3-6 months of expenses.

### Baby Step 4: Invest 15% of Income
Put 15% of gross income into retirement accounts (401k, Roth IRA).

### Baby Step 5: Children's College Fund
Save for children's education (ESA, 529 plans).

### Baby Step 6: Pay Off Home Early
Put all extra money toward paying off the mortgage.

### Baby Step 7: Build Wealth and Give
Invest, build wealth, and give generously.

## Key Philosophy

### "Personal finance is 20% head knowledge and 80% behavior"

This is Ramsey's most important insight. He argues that:
- Most people know they shouldn't overspend
- The problem is behavior, not knowledge
- Financial tools should account for human psychology
- Small wins build momentum (hence debt snowball)

### The Debt Snowball vs. Avalanche Debate

**Ramsey's Position (Snowball):**
- Pay smallest balance first
- Quick wins provide motivation
- Behavioral success > mathematical optimization
- People are more likely to stick with it

**Mathematical Position (Avalanche):**
- Pay highest interest rate first
- Saves more money in interest
- Optimal from pure math perspective

**Research Reality:**
Studies (including from Northwestern and Harvard) show the snowball method does lead to higher completion rates, validating Ramsey's behavioral approach—even if it costs more in interest.

## What Dave Ramsey Does Well

5. **Consistent Message:** Same advice for 30+ years

## Key Criticisms

### From Financial Advisors (Michael Kitces, etc.)

#### 1. $1,000 Emergency Fund Is Too Small
- In 2026, $1,000 doesn't cover most emergencies
- Car repair, medical bill, or home issue easily exceeds this
- May cause people to go back into debt during Baby Step 2

#### 2. Pausing 401k Match Is Costly
- Ramsey advises pausing retirement contributions during Baby Step 2
- Losing employer match = losing free money
- Time in market matters; lost years hurt compound growth

#### 3. The 12% Return Assumption
- Ramsey often cites 12% average stock market returns
- Most advisors use 7-8% (inflation-adjusted)
- Leads to overly optimistic retirement projections

#### 4. Ignoring Interest Rate Math
- Debt snowball ignores interest rates
- Someone with a $500 balance at 5% and $5,000 at 25% should obviously tackle the 25%
- Can cost thousands in unnecessary interest

#### 5. Anti-Credit Card Absolutism
- Ramsey says NO credit cards, ever
- Responsible credit card users miss out on:
  - Purchase protection
  - Cash back / rewards
  - Credit building
  - Fraud protection
- Not everyone becomes addicted to credit

### Contextual Limitations
- Advice designed for people in crisis
- May be too conservative for financially stable users
- Religious framing doesn't resonate with everyone
- One-size-fits-all ignores individual circumstances
