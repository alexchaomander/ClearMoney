# Financial Samurai (Sam Dogen)

## Overview

Sam Dogen is the founder of Financial Samurai, one of the largest independently-owned personal finance websites with roughly one million organic visitors per month. He represents a unique voice in the FIRE space: someone with an actual Wall Street background who retired early and now shares strategies for high-income professionals.

## Background

- **Career:** 13 years in investment banking at Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse
- **Retired:** Age 34 (2012) via negotiated severance
- **Education:** MBA and finance background
- **Location:** San Francisco Bay Area
- **Started Financial Samurai:** July 2009, during the financial crisis

## Key Philosophy

### "Stealth Wealth"
Unlike flashy finance influencers, Sam advocates for building wealth quietly without displaying it. This resonates with high-income professionals who want to avoid judgment or solicitation.

### Real Numbers, Real Context
Sam shares actual portfolio values, income streams, and spending breakdowns. His controversial post "Scraping By On $500,000 A Year" sparked debate but illustrated how expenses scale with income in high-cost-of-living areas.

### Severance as FIRE Catalyst
His #1 catalyst for leaving banking was negotiating a severance package that covered 5+ years of expenses. He actively teaches readers how to engineer their own layoffs to get severance rather than just quitting.

## Core Concepts

### 1. The 1/10th Rule for Car Buying
Never spend more than 1/10th of your gross annual income on a car. A $200K earner should max out at $20K for a vehicle.

### 2. 30/30/3 Home Buying Rule
- Spend no more than 30% of gross income on housing
- Have a 30% down payment
- Home price should be no more than 3x annual income

### 3. FS-DAIR (Financial Samurai Debt And Investment Ratio)
Balance debt paydown with investing based on interest rates and market conditions.

### 4. Passive Income Focus
Sam retired on approximately $80,000/year in passive income from:
- Real estate (rental properties)
- Dividend stocks
- Bond interest
- Online business income
