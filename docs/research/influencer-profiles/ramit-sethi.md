# Ramit Sethi

> **ClearMoney Position:** Adopt the automation-first, guilt-free spending philosophy. His frameworks are excellent foundations for our tools.

## Overview

**Brand:** I Will Teach You To Be Rich
**Platforms:** iwillteachyoutoberich.com, Netflix show, podcast
**Background:** Stanford graduate, entrepreneur, author
**Book:** "I Will Teach You To Be Rich" (NYT bestseller)
**Philosophy:** Automate finances, spend extravagantly on what you love, cut mercilessly on what you don't

## Core Concepts

### 1. Conscious Spending Plan

Ramit's alternative to traditional budgets:

| Category | Percentage | Purpose |
|----------|------------|---------|
| Fixed Costs | 50-60% | Rent, utilities, insurance, debt minimums |
| Investments | 10% | 401k, IRA, taxable accounts |
| Savings | 5-10% | Emergency fund, vacation, big purchases |
| Guilt-Free Spending | 20-35% | Whatever you want, no judgment |

**Key Difference from Traditional Budgets:**
- No tracking every penny
- No guilt about discretionary spending
- Set percentages, automate, forget
- Focus on big wins, not small expenses

### 2. Money Dials

Ramit identifies 10 spending categories where people have different preferences:

1. **Convenience** - Time-saving services, delivery, premium options
2. **Travel** - Experiences, flights, hotels, adventures
3. **Health/Fitness** - Gym, trainers, equipment, organic food
4. **Relationships** - Gifts, meals out with friends, experiences with loved ones
5. **Food** - Restaurants, cooking, specialty ingredients
6. **Self-Improvement** - Courses, books, coaching, education
7. **Freedom** - Working less, financial independence, options
8. **Generosity** - Giving to family, charity, causes
9. **Luxury** - High-end items, designer goods, premium experiences
10. **Creativity** - Art supplies, instruments, hobby equipment

**The Philosophy:**
> "Turn UP the dials on things you love. Turn DOWN dials on things you don't care about."

**Example:**
- Person A: Loves travel, doesn't care about cars → Splurge on trips, drive a Honda
- Person B: Loves cars, doesn't care about travel → Nice car, staycations

### 3. Automation First

Ramit's systems approach:

```
Paycheck Arrives
    ↓
401k (Auto-deducted) → 10%+ to retirement
    ↓
Direct Deposit → Checking Account
    ↓
Auto-transfers:
    → Savings Account (Emergency fund)
    → Investment Account (Taxable)
    → Sub-savings (Vacation, goals)
    ↓
Remaining = Guilt-Free Spending
```

**Time Investment:** <1 hour/month once set up

### 4. Focus on Big Wins

Ramit's hierarchy of financial impact:

| Big Wins | Small Stuff |
|----------|-------------|
| Negotiate salary (+$10k) | Cut latte (-$5) |
| Automate savings | Track every expense |
| Optimize credit cards | Clip coupons |
| Refinance debt | Switch to generic brands |
| Increase income | Cancel subscriptions |

**The Point:** One salary negotiation provides more value than years of cutting lattes.
