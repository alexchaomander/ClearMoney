# White Coat Investor (James Dahle, MD)

## Overview

James M. Dahle, MD, FACEP, FAAEM is a practicing emergency physician and founder of The White Coat Investor, the most widely read physician-specific personal finance website in the world. While focused on doctors, his content applies broadly to high-income professionals who face similar challenges: high student debt, late career starts, and complex compensation.

## Background

- **Career:** Practicing emergency physician
- **Credentials:** MD, FACEP, FAAEM
- **Founded:** White Coat Investor in 2011
- **Origin:** Became disillusioned after being mistreated by unscrupulous financial professionals
- **Author:** "The White Coat Investor: A Doctor's Guide to Personal Finance and Investing"

## Why He Matters for Tech Workers

While WCI targets physicians, the parallels to tech workers are striking:
- **High income, late start:** Doctors often start earning at 30+, similar to PhD/graduate degree holders in tech
- **Complex compensation:** Physician contracts mirror tech equity complexity
- **Targeted by predatory advisors:** High earners attract bad actors
- **Burnout risk:** Both professions have significant burnout affecting financial plans
- **Student debt:** Many tech workers also carry significant debt

## Key Philosophy

### "Live Like a Resident"
New physicians should continue living on a resident's salary ($50-60K) for 2-5 years after becoming an attending ($200K+), using the difference to eliminate debt and build wealth rapidly.

**Tech equivalent:** Live on your base salary, bank your RSUs.

### The 20% Rule
Save 20% of gross income for retirement. If invested reasonably, this alone can make you a multimillionaire by career end.

### Financial Literacy is Self-Defense
Doctors (and by extension, all high earners) are targets. Learning finance is necessary protection against:
- High-fee advisors
- Bad insurance products
- Whole life insurance salespeople
- Complex investments they don't need

## Core Concepts

### 1. The Waterfall Method
Prioritize financial decisions in order:
1. Get 401(k) match (free money)
2. Pay off high-interest debt
3. Max tax-advantaged accounts
4. Pay off moderate-interest debt
5. Taxable investing
6. Pay off low-interest debt

### 2. Index Fund Investing
90-95% of professional fund managers underperform index funds long-term. WCI strongly advocates for low-cost index funds over active management.

### 3. The Burnout Factor
> "The No. 1 threat to your financial plan is physician burnout."

If you can't work, your financial plans collapse. This makes:
- Disability insurance critical
- Emergency funds essential
- Lifestyle inflation dangerous

### 4. Variable vs Fixed Expenses
Keep spending variable rather than fixed. High fixed costs (big mortgage, car payments) limit ability to adjust if burnout or financial strain hits.

## Target Audience

- Physicians at all career stages
- Dentists and high-income healthcare professionals
- High-income professionals generally ($200K-$1M+)
- Those who feel targeted by financial salespeople
- People who want to DIY their finances

## Criticisms of the Financial Industry

WCI is particularly vocal about:

### 1. AUM (Assets Under Management) Fees
Many advisors charge 1% AUM, which on a $2M portfolio is $20K/year for what might be 5 hours of work.

### 2. Whole Life Insurance
Aggressively marketed to doctors as "investment," but usually benefits the salesperson more than the buyer.

### 3. Commission-Based "Advice"
"Advisors" who are actually salespeople pushing products that pay them commissions.
