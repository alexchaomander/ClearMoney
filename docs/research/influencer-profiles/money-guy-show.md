## Key Philosophy

### The "Financial Order of Operations" (FOO)
Their signature framework for prioritizing financial decisions:

1. **Deductibles covered** - Emergency fund basics
2. **Employer match** - Get all free money
3. **High-interest debt** - Pay off anything above 6%
4. **Emergency reserves** - 3-6 months expenses
5. **Roth IRA/HSA** - Max tax-free growth
6. **Max retirement** - 401k/403b to limit
7. **Hyper-accumulation** - Taxable brokerage
8. **Prepay debt** - Mortgage payoff
9. **Prepay future expenses** - 529s, etc.

### Wealth Multiplier Concept
They emphasize how much $1 saved at different ages becomes at retirement:
- $1 at age 20 → ~$88 at 65
- $1 at age 30 → ~$45 at 65
- $1 at age 40 → ~$22 at 65

This creates urgency for young high earners.

### The 25% Savings Rule
Save 25-30% of gross income for wealth building. This is more aggressive than typical advice (10-15%) but achievable for high earners.

They explicitly address $150K-$500K+ earners:
- When pre-tax vs Roth makes sense
- Mega backdoor Roth strategies
- Deferred compensation considerations
- Tax bracket management

### 2. Pre-Tax vs Roth Decision Framework
Based on combined federal + state marginal rate:
- **Under 25%:** Probably Roth (pay taxes now at low rate)
- **Over 25%:** Probably Traditional (defer taxes)
- **Between:** Depends on state, future expectations
