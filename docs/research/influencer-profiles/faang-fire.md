# FAANG FIRE (Andre Nader)

## Overview

Andre Nader writes the FAANG FIRE newsletter, providing financial independence content specifically tailored to tech workers. As an ex-Meta employee who achieved FIRE after being laid off, he offers an authentic perspective on navigating equity compensation, high incomes, and early retirement in the tech industry.

## Background

- **Career:** 15+ years in tech, including 9.5 years at Facebook/Meta on the Product Growth team
- **Exit:** Laid off from Meta in May 2023
- **Status:** Semi-retired at age 36, living in San Francisco
- **Family:** Partner and 5-year-old child
- **Platform:** Substack newsletter at faangfire.com

## Origin Story

After being laid off, Andre realized he didn't need to go back to work thanks to years of high income and diligent savings. He discovered a stigma: just because you earn a lot of money, people assume you know what to do with it. Meanwhile, tech workers' LinkedIn inboxes were flooded with advisors trying to sell them something.

He started FAANG FIRE to provide a free resource from someone who:
- Actually walked the same path
- Has no financial products to sell
- Understands the specific challenges of tech compensation

## Key Philosophy

### "Optionality of Time"
His mission is to empower tech workers with the optionality that financial independence brings. It's not about never working again—it's about having the choice.

### Authenticity Over Expertise
Andre isn't a CFP or financial advisor. He's a tech worker who figured it out and shares what he's learned. This peer-to-peer approach resonates with his audience.

### Transparency
He shares real numbers, real timelines, and real struggles—including the psychological challenges of early retirement.

## Core Content

### 1. Total Compensation Dashboard (Free Tool)
A spreadsheet that helps tech workers understand their total comp:
- Annual total compensation projections
- Monthly income summaries
- Upcoming RSU vests
- Grant-by-grant tracking

### 2. RSU Strategy Guidance
How to think about RSUs:
- When to sell vs hold
- Tax implications
- Concentration risk
- Diversification strategies

### 3. FIRE Variants
Andre coined "AvocadoFIRE" as a playful middle ground:
- Not as extreme as LeanFIRE
- Not as excessive as FatFIRE
- Comfortable but not lavish
- Allows for occasional indulgences (like avocados)

### 4. Life After FAANG
Content about the psychological and practical aspects of leaving big tech:
- Identity beyond job title
- Structuring time
- Healthcare without employer
- Social connections

## Target Audience
