- "Dividends covered my Netflix subscription"
- Makes abstract numbers tangible and motivating

## Content Highlights

### 4. Not Beginner-Friendly Scale
- Shows portfolios in hundreds of thousands
- Can be discouraging for those starting small
- "My dividends this month" often exceed monthly salaries
