# The FIRE Movement

> **ClearMoney Position:** Provide the math and tools while acknowledging FIRE isn't for everyone.

## Overview

**FIRE:** Financial Independence, Retire Early
**Key Figures:** Mr. Money Mustache, JL Collins, ERN (Big ERN), Paula Pant
**Philosophy:** High savings rate + index investing = early retirement
**Core Blog:** mrmoneymustache.com (Pete Adeney)

## The Movement's Origins

### Mr. Money Mustache (Pete Adeney)
- Retired at 30 with ~$600k saved
- Started blog in 2011, became cultural phenomenon
- Key insight: Savings rate, not income, determines retirement timeline
- Introduced "shockingly simple math" to mainstream

### Other Key Voices
- **JL Collins:** "The Simple Path to Wealth," stock series
- **ERN (Big ERN):** "Safe Withdrawal Rate Series," deep mathematical analysis
- **Paula Pant:** "Afford Anything," opportunity cost focus
- **ChooseFI:** Podcast popularizing movement

## The Core Math

### The Shockingly Simple Math Behind Early Retirement

Pete Adeney's foundational insight:

| Savings Rate | Years to Retirement* |
|--------------|---------------------|
| 10% | 51 years |
| 20% | 37 years |
| 30% | 28 years |
| 40% | 22 years |
| 50% | 17 years |
| 60% | 12.5 years |
| 70% | 8.5 years |
| 80% | 5.5 years |

*Assuming 5% real returns, starting from $0

**The Key Insight:** Your savings rate is the single most important variable. A 50% savings rate means:
1. You're living on half your income
2. You're saving the other half
3. Each year of work pays for one year of retirement
4. You need ~17 years of savings to cover remaining life

### The 4% Rule (Safe Withdrawal Rate)

The FIRE community's cornerstone:
- Based on Trinity Study (1998)
- Withdraw 4% of portfolio annually
- 95%+ success rate over 30 years historically
- $1M portfolio = $40,000/year spending

**Calculation:**
```
Annual Spending × 25 = Target Portfolio
$40,000 × 25 = $1,000,000
```

### Variations (ERN's Research)

Big ERN's Safe Withdrawal Rate series refined the 4% rule:
- 3.25-3.5% may be safer for longer retirements (40+ years)
- Flexibility in spending improves success rates
- Sequence of returns risk is real
- Geographic arbitrage can reduce needed portfolio

## Types of FIRE

### 1. Lean FIRE
- Very frugal lifestyle
- Target: $500k-$750k portfolio
- Spending: $20-30k/year
- Trade-off: Less lifestyle flexibility

### 2. Fat FIRE
- Comfortable/affluent lifestyle
- Target: $2.5M+ portfolio
- Spending: $100k+/year
- Trade-off: Requires higher income or longer timeline

### 3. Barista FIRE
- Part-time work covers some expenses
- Smaller portfolio needed
- Benefits: Health insurance, social connection
- Hybrid approach for those who enjoy some work

### 4. Coast FIRE
- Enough invested that compound growth covers retirement
- Can stop contributing and "coast" to traditional retirement
- Work income covers current expenses only
- Less pressure, more career flexibility

## Key Concepts

### Opportunity Cost of Everything
Every dollar spent is a dollar not invested. The true cost:
- $5 latte = $5 today
- $5 invested at 7% for 30 years = $38
- Real cost of latte = $38 in future dollars

### Geographic Arbitrage
- Earn in high-cost area
- Retire in low-cost area (or country)
- $1M in NYC ≠ $1M in Portugal
- Popular destinations: Portugal, Mexico, Thailand, Eastern Europe

### The One More Year Syndrome
The psychological trap of never feeling "ready":
- Portfolio hits target, but "one more year" for safety
- Becomes two years, three years...
- Solution: Clear criteria decided in advance

## What the FIRE Movement Does Well

1. **Mathematical Clarity:** Simple, clear equations
2. **Community:** Massive online support network
3. **Paradigm Shift:** Challenges work-until-65 assumption
4. **Specific Guidance:** "Save 50%, invest in index funds, wait"
5. **Diverse Approaches:** Lean, Fat, Barista, Coast options
6. **Success Stories:** Many documented early retirees

## Key Criticisms

### 1. Privilege and Starting Position
- Easier with high income
- Ignores debt, family obligations, health costs
- Tech workers overrepresented in community
- Not accessible to everyone

### 2. 4% Rule Concerns
- Based on historical data, future may differ
- Designed for 30 years, not 50+ years
- Healthcare costs rising faster than inflation
- US-centric data

### 3. Purpose and Meaning
- Early retirement can lead to identity crisis
- What do you DO all day?
- Many FIRE bloggers still work (just differently)
- Humans need purpose beyond leisure

### 4. Frugality Can Become Extreme
- "Mustachian" frugality not for everyone
- Quality of life during accumulation matters
- Delayed gratification has limits
- Life happens during the journey, not just destination

### 5. Market Dependency
- Assumes markets continue historical performance
- Sequence of returns risk is real
- Major downturn in early retirement is devastating
- Geographic arbitrage has visa/political risks
