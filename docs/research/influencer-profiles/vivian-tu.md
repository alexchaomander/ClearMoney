> **ClearMoney Position:** Embrace the accessible, non-judgmental approach while providing the tools Gen Z and millennials need.

## Overview

**Brand:** Your Rich BFF
**Platforms:** TikTok (2.2M+), Instagram, Podcast
**Background:** Former Wall Street trader at J.P. Morgan
**Age Demographic:** Primarily Gen Z and young millennials
**Philosophy:** Make finance "FUN-ance" - accessible, non-judgmental, practical

## Background Story

Vivian Tu's path to becoming "Your Rich BFF":
- Grew up in a first-generation immigrant household
- Worked as a trader at J.P. Morgan on Wall Street
- Left a $600K+ Wall Street salary to create content
- Built following through relatable, clear financial explanations
- Now one of the most influential Gen Z finance voices

## Core Philosophy

### Making Finance "FUN-ance"

Vivian's approach breaks from traditional finance:
- **No judgment:** Everyone starts somewhere
- **No jargon:** Explains concepts in plain English
- **Pop culture references:** Uses celebrities, trends to explain concepts
- **Short-form content:** Optimized for TikTok attention spans
- **Empathy first:** Acknowledges systemic barriers

### The Avocado Toast Debunk

One of Vivian's signature takes: debunking the "avocado toast" myth.

**The Myth:**
> "Millennials can't afford homes because they spend too much on avocado toast."

**Vivian's Math:**
- Avocado toast: ~$12
- Even daily: $4,380/year
- Average home down payment: $60,000+
- Cutting avocado toast for 14 years = one down payment
- Meanwhile: wages stagnant, housing up 400%+

**The Point:** Small purchases aren't the problem. Systemic issues (wages, housing costs, student debt) are. Don't blame individuals for structural problems.

### The "College Roommate" Vibe

- Uses Kim Kardashian to explain private equity
