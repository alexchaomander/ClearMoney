# Vision: The Strata Action Layer (SAL)

## The Financial "Dead End" Problem
Most fintech today is a "dead end." You connect your accounts, you see a pretty chart, and then... nothing happens. If you want to actually *do* something—rebalance a portfolio, move cash to a higher yield, or switch banks—the burden of execution falls entirely on the user. They have to navigate 1990s-era bank UI, fill out paper forms, and manage the "hand-off" of data manually.

**Strata's mission is to turn financial data into financial action by giving every user an Autonomous Economic Agent.**

## The Three Eras of Strata

### Era 1: The Context Graph (Current)
*   **Focus:** Read-only aggregation and intelligent mapping.
*   **Goal:** Build the most comprehensive "Context Window" of a user's financial life.
*   **Product:** ClearMoney dashboard, smart calculators, and rule-based insights.

### Era 2: The Drafting & Bridge Layer (The Intermediate Ground)
*   **Focus:** Removing "Cognitive Friction" and bridging legacy systems to the future.
*   **Goal:** The AI prepares the action, handles the "Switch Kit," and automates the legacy paperwork.
*   **Mechanics:**
    *   **Ghost Navigation:** Side-by-side guidance for legacy bank UIs.
    *   **Automated Switch Kits:** AI-generated ACATS and ACH forms for e-signature.
    *   **Legacy-to-Agent Bridges:** Converting "Read-Only" bank data into "Action-Ready" agent tokens.

### Era 3: The Agentic Ledger (The Long-Term Bet)
*   **Focus:** Autonomous Economic Citizens & Programmable Money.
*   **Goal:** Users move their "Primary System of Record" from a legacy bank to a Strata-managed **Agentic Ledger**.
*   **Mechanics:**
    *   **Autonomous Accounts:** Every user's agent has its own programmable wallet (via Smart Accounts) to execute sub-second rebalancing, payments, and investments.
    *   **The Agent Economy:** Agents pay other agents for services (tax prep, alpha research, risk analysis) using protocols like L402 or Skyfire.
    *   **Strata as the Clearing House:** We become the verifiable truth for the "Agent-to-Agent" economy.

## Core Principles

### 1. The Autonomous Economic Citizen
In the future, humans won't "manage" money; they will set **Financial Intent** for their agents. Strata provides the infrastructure—the identity, the data, and the ledger—that allows these agents to act as sovereign economic participants.

### 2. Standardized Portability (The Anti-Silo)
Users own their data. Through the **Financial Portability Protocol (FPP)**, a user can "unplug" their context from Strata and move it to any other FPP-compatible system. We win on the quality of our execution, not on the difficulty of leaving.

### 3. Execution Transparency (Traceability)
Every action taken by an agent is backed by a **Decision Trace**. We solve the "Black Box" problem of AI by making every dollar moved explainable and verifiable.

## Strategic Moat: The Integration Ecosystem
We don't build the ledger, the wallet, or the payment rail from scratch. We integrate with the best-in-class "Agent-Native" providers:
*   **Safe (Smart Accounts):** For programmable, secure asset storage.
*   **Skyfire:** For agent-to-agent payment rails.
*   **Near Protocol:** For high-speed, intent-based execution.
*   **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZK):** For "Privacy-Preserving Proof of Funds" during transfers.

By building the "Idealized Product" (The Action-Native Dashboard) and bridging legacy users into this ecosystem, we gradually replace legacy banks as the user's primary financial home.
