# ClearMoney Brand Guide

*Last updated: February 2026*

---

## Brand Essence

**ClearMoney is the financial operating system that shows its work.**

In one sentence: We give you the same financial intelligence that institutions have, but we show you every input, formula, and assumption behind every number -- and then we help you act on it.

---

## Brand Story

### The Problem

The financial advice industry is broken in two ways:

**The Black-Box Problem.** A new wave of AI financial advisors (CFO Silvia, Wealthfront, Betterment) will tell you what to do with your money. But they won't tell you *why*. They won't show you the calculation. They won't let you verify the assumptions. You're supposed to trust the algorithm -- the same way you were supposed to trust your advisor at Merrill Lynch. Different technology, same information asymmetry.

**The Affiliate Problem.** The websites and publications that are supposed to help you make financial decisions -- The Points Guy, NerdWallet, Bankrate -- are paid by the companies whose products they "review." Their business model is fundamentally misaligned with your interests. When every recommendation earns them $200-$500 in commissions, how do you know the advice is for you and not for their revenue?

### Our Answer

ClearMoney solves both problems with one principle: **radical transparency.**

- Every number on ClearMoney is traceable to its source data
- Every AI recommendation comes with a full decision trace: the inputs, the rules applied, the assumptions made, and the confidence level
- Every product recommendation discloses what we earn from it -- and we prove our rankings are independent of our payouts
- We don't just advise. We draft the paperwork, generate the transfer documents, and let you execute -- all within your control

We believe that if you can see the math, you can make your own decisions. And we think that's the point.

## Brand Identity

### Name

**ClearMoney**

The name communicates our core value proposition in two words: clarity applied to money. It's direct, memorable, and descriptive. No cleverness that requires explanation. No jargon that alienates.

### Tagline Options

**Primary:** *See the math. Make the move.*

**Alternatives:**
- *Your money, fully transparent.*
- *The financial OS that shows its work.*
- *Every number. Every source. Every reason.*

### Brand Pillars

| Pillar | What It Means | How It Shows Up |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Radical Transparency** | Every number is auditable. Every recommendation is traceable. | "Show the Math" traces, decision narratives, open methodology, payout disclosure |
| **Financial Empowerment** | We make you more capable, not more dependent. | Tools and education over black-box answers; users learn *why*, not just *what* |
| **Intellectual Honesty** | We take real positions and prove them with data. | Clear stances on products, public independence reports, admitting uncertainty |
| **Action Over Advice** | We go beyond telling you what to do. | Switch kits, ACATS paperwork, action intents, War Room execution |
| **Respect for Intelligence** | We never waste your time or insult your intelligence. | Concise content, no dark patterns, no SEO filler, no manipulative urgency |

---

## Target Audience

### Primary: Startup Founders

**Who:** Technical founders (seed to Series B) managing personal + company finances simultaneously.

**Their pain:** Commingled accounts, unclear runway, equity compensation complexity, no time for a traditional financial advisor, distrust of cookie-cutter robo-advisors.

**Why ClearMoney:** Founder Operating Room, entity separation, runway intelligence, cap table integration, tax shield monitoring. No other platform serves this niche.

**Where they are:** Twitter/X, Hacker News, Y Combinator community, founder Slack groups, r/startups, r/fatFIRE.

**How we reach them:** Word of mouth (founders talk to founders), founder-specific content, product-led growth through the free tier.

### Secondary: Financially Sophisticated Individuals

**Who:** Engineers, doctors, lawyers, and professionals with $250k-$5M+ in investable assets who are too smart for generic advice but don't want to pay 1% AUM to a human advisor.

**Their pain:** Scattered accounts across multiple institutions, no unified view, no confidence in AI advice they can't verify, tired of affiliate-driven product recommendations.

**Why ClearMoney:** Comprehensive wealth picture, "Show the Math" transparency, advanced modeling, tax optimization, multi-channel access.

**Where they are:** r/personalfinance, r/fatFIRE, r/Bogleheads, Twitter/X fintwit, Hacker News, financial podcasts.

**How we reach them:** Blog content (credit card & rewards vertical for top-of-funnel), SEO, newsletter, YouTube.

### Tertiary: Informed Consumers

**Who:** Anyone who's tired of being sold to instead of served. People who've been burned by bad financial advice, inflated points valuations, or hidden fees.

**Their pain:** Information asymmetry. They know "best card" lists are rigged but don't have an alternative. They want honest analysis, not marketing.

**Why ClearMoney:** Independent publication, honest card reviews, open points valuations, affiliate payout disclosure.

**Where they are:** Reddit (r/creditcards, r/churning, r/personalfinance), Google search, TikTok/YouTube financial content.

**How we reach them:** ClearMoney Publication (credit card & rewards content), social media, programmatic comparison pages.

## Brand Voice

### Voice Attributes

| Attribute | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Direct** | We say what we mean. No hedge language, no weasel words. | "This card isn't worth it for most people" -- not "This card could potentially be a consideration for some" |
| **Technically Competent** | We understand the math and explain it clearly. | "Your effective tax rate is 28.3%. Here's why, and here are 3 ways to bring it to 24.1%." |
| **Respectful** | We assume the reader is smart. We explain, we don't lecture. | "Here's how the calculation works" -- not "Let us break this down for you in simple terms" |
| **Honest** | We take clear positions. We admit uncertainty. We show our conflicts. | "We earn $350 if you apply for this card. We still recommend it because the math works. Here's the math." |
| **Concise** | We respect your time. Every word earns its place. | 800-1,200 word articles max. No filler paragraphs. No "In today's fast-paced world..." openers. |
| **Slightly Irreverent** | We're serious about money but not about ourselves. | "The Points Guy says this card is worth it. The Points Guy also earns $450 every time you apply." |

### Voice Do's and Don'ts

**Do:**
- Take clear stances backed by data
- Use specific numbers, not vague qualifiers
- Explain the "why" behind every recommendation
- Acknowledge when you're uncertain or when the answer truly depends
- Reference the actual math
- Call out bad practices by name

**Don't:**
- Hedge everything to avoid controversy ("it depends on your situation")
- Use financial jargon without explanation
- Write filler for SEO ("In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore...")
- Sound like a compliance department
- Sound like a salesperson
- Use urgency or scarcity tactics ("Limited time! Apply now!")
- Use superlatives without proof ("The best card ever")

### Voice Examples

**Product (Dashboard):**

> **Bad:** "Your portfolio may benefit from some adjustments based on current market conditions."
>
> **Good:** "Your tech allocation drifted to 34% (target: 25%). Rebalancing now would cost $420 in short-term gains taxes. Waiting 47 days would save $310 (lots convert to long-term). [Show the Math]"

**Publication (Blog):**

> **Bad:** "The Chase Sapphire Reserve could potentially be a solid choice for some travelers who value premium benefits and don't mind paying a higher annual fee for the right card that fits their lifestyle needs."
>
> **Good:** "The Chase Sapphire Reserve costs $550/year. If you don't spend at least $4,000 on travel and dining annually, it's not worth it. Here's the math."

**Marketing (Landing Page):**

> **Bad:** "ClearMoney leverages cutting-edge AI technology to provide comprehensive financial insights for your journey to financial freedom."
>
> **Good:** "Every number on ClearMoney shows its source. Every recommendation shows its reasoning. No black boxes. No hidden agendas."

**Email (Alert):**

> **Bad:** "We noticed some interesting changes in your portfolio that you might want to review at your earliest convenience."
>
> **Good:** "AAPL is now 22% of your portfolio (up from 18% last month). Want us to draft a rebalancing trade? [Review in War Room]"

**Social (Twitter/X):**

> **Bad:** "Excited to share our latest blog post about credit card rewards! Check it out!"
>
> **Good:** "TPG values Chase UR points at 2.0 cpp. Our methodology, which we publish in full, says 1.4 cpp. Here's why the gap matters and what it costs you: [link]"

## Visual Identity

### Design System: Strata

ClearMoney uses the **Strata** design system -- named for the geological layers of data that underpin every surface. The visual language conveys institutional authority, precision, and clarity.

### Typography

| Usage | Typeface | Weight | Why |
|-------|----------|--------|-----|
| **Headlines & Editorial** | Serif (e.g., Instrument Serif, Source Serif Pro) | Medium-Bold | Authority, credibility, editorial tradition |
| **Body Text** | Sans-serif (e.g., Inter, Geist) | Regular | Clean readability for long-form content |
| **Financial Data & Metrics** | Monospace (e.g., JetBrains Mono, IBM Plex Mono) | Regular | Precision, data credibility, scanability |
| **UI Labels & Navigation** | Sans-serif (same as body) | Medium | Clarity, consistency |

### Color System

| Color | Hex | Semantic Meaning | Usage |
|-------|-----|-----------------|-------|
| **Emerald** | `#10B981` | Growth, positive change, gains | Portfolio gains, positive metrics, success states |
| **Amber** | `#F59E0B` | Warning, attention needed | Drift alerts, approaching thresholds, medium severity |
| **Red** | `#EF4444` | Critical, loss, danger | Portfolio losses, critical alerts, high severity |
| **Slate** | `#64748B` | Neutral, informational | Body text, secondary information, borders |
| **Zinc** | `#18181B` / `#FAFAFA` | Surface, background | Dark mode bg / Light mode bg |
| **White/Black** | `#FFFFFF` / `#09090B` | Primary text | Text on dark / Text on light |

### Design Principles

1. **Data-forward.** Charts, numbers, and traces are the visual centerpiece. Not stock photos, not illustrations, not icons.

2. **Institutional, not consumer.** The aesthetic should feel like a Bloomberg terminal that went to design school -- not like a banking app trying to be friendly.

3. **Information density.** Respect the user's screen real estate. Show more data, not more whitespace. Think financial dashboard, not marketing website.

4. **Dark mode default.** The dashboard defaults to dark mode. It's easier on the eyes for data-heavy screens and signals seriousness. Light mode is fully supported.

5. **Motion with purpose.** Animations exist to convey state changes and data transitions (Framer Motion). Never for decoration. The "agent pulse" indicates AI activity. Skeleton states show loading progress.

6. **No visual cliches.** Never use:
   - Stock photos of people looking at laptops
   - "Luxury lifestyle" imagery
   - Generic diverse-hands-around-table corporate photography
   - Rocket ship or "to the moon" imagery
   - Piggy banks, coin stacks, or other financial cliches

### Logo & Mark

The ClearMoney mark should convey:
- **Clarity** -- clean, geometric, no ornamental detail
- **Precision** -- sharp edges, intentional spacing
- **Trust** -- stable, balanced, grounded

*(Logo design TBD -- work with a designer. The mark should work at 16px favicon size and at billboard scale.)*

## Messaging Framework

### Elevator Pitch (10 seconds)

> "ClearMoney is a financial OS that shows you the math behind every number and helps you execute on it."

### Short Pitch (30 seconds)

> "ClearMoney is the financial operating system for people who want to see the math. We aggregate your entire financial life -- investments, real estate, equity, debt -- and show you the inputs, formula, and confidence score behind every number. When you're ready to act, we draft the paperwork and help you execute. No black boxes. No hidden agendas."

### Full Pitch (2 minutes)

> "The financial advisory industry has two failure modes. AI advisors like CFO Silvia will tell you what to do, but they won't show you why. Affiliate-driven media like The Points Guy will recommend products, but they're paid by the companies they review.
>
> ClearMoney solves both problems with radical transparency. Every number on the platform is traceable to its source data. Every AI recommendation comes with a full decision trace -- the inputs, the rules, the assumptions, and the confidence level. Every product recommendation discloses what we earn from it.
>
> But we go further than transparency. While other platforms stop at advice, ClearMoney helps you execute. We draft ACATS transfer paperwork, generate switch kits, and manage the entire action lifecycle through our War Room -- with you in control at every step.
>
> And for startup founders, we've built specialized intelligence that no one else offers: entity separation, runway tracking, commingling detection, cap table integration, and tax shield monitoring.
>
> ClearMoney: see the math, make the move."

### Key Messages by Audience

**For Founders:**
> "ClearMoney is the only financial OS built for founders. Track personal and company finances separately, monitor your runway in real-time, catch commingling before your accountant does, and model your equity compensation -- all with full transparency on every calculation."

**For Investors/HNW:**
> "ClearMoney gives you institutional-grade portfolio intelligence without the 1% AUM fee. See your complete wealth picture across every account and asset class, with the math behind every metric visible on hover. When you're ready to rebalance or optimize taxes, we draft the trades and transfers for you."

**For Credit Card / Points Audience (Publication):**
> "We're the anti-affiliate card review site. Every recommendation shows what we earn from it. Every 'best card' ranking is ordered by math, not by commission. Every points valuation publishes its full methodology. If we can't show the math, we don't make the claim."

## Content & Publication Identity

### The ClearMoney Publication

The ClearMoney Publication is the editorial and content arm of the platform. It operates with editorial independence and applies the same "show the math" standard to content that the product applies to financial data.

**Publication mission:** Make financial decisions less opaque by replacing marketing-driven content with math-driven analysis.

### Content Verticals

| Vertical | Audience | Tone | Funnel Role |
|----------|----------|------|-------------|
| **Credit Cards & Rewards** | Broad consumer | Slightly irreverent, data-driven, contrarian | Top of funnel (SEO, social, viral potential) |
| **Portfolio & Tax Strategy** | Investors, HNW | Technical, precise, authoritative | Mid-funnel (newsletter, search) |
| **Founder Finance** | Startup founders | Practical, empathetic, direct | Bottom of funnel (direct product pipeline) |
| **Industry Accountability** | Everyone | Bold, investigative, adversarial to incumbents | Brand building (PR, social, differentiation) |

### Publication Voice (How It Differs From Product Voice)

The publication is slightly more opinionated and confrontational than the product. The product is a neutral tool that shows data. The publication takes stances.

| Product Voice | Publication Voice |
|--------------|-------------------|
| "Your Amex Platinum costs $695/year. Based on your spending, you're getting $420 in value." | "The Amex Platinum is a bad card for most people. Here's the math most sites won't show you." |
| "Tax-loss harvesting opportunity detected: $2,400 potential savings." | "You're leaving $2,400 on the table every year if you're not tax-loss harvesting. Here's exactly how to do it." |
| Neutral, data-forward | Opinionated, contrarian, educational |

### Editorial Independence Pledge

The ClearMoney Publication operates under the same independence pledge as the product:

- We will never recommend a product because of its affiliate payout
- We will always show our math
- We will publish negative reviews even if it costs us revenue
- We will disclose exactly how we make money
- We will publish quarterly Independence Reports showing:
  - Affiliate revenue by product category
  - Instances where our top recommendation != highest-paying option
  - Reader feedback and corrections made
  - Any pressure received from companies
