Every founder knows their **Runway**. It's the first slide in every board deck, the most common question from every seed investor, and the number that keeps you up at 3:00 AM.

But most founders are calculating it wrong.

### The Problem with Traditional Runway Math

Traditional runway is simple: `Company Cash / Monthly Burn = Months of Life`. 

While this works for a Series C company with $50M in the bank, it is a dangerous oversimplification for early-stage founders. Why? Because it ignores the **Personal Survival Paradox**.

### The Personal Survival Paradox

For an early-stage founder, your personal life and your company are inextricably linked. If your personal bank account hits zero, you can't lead the company. If you stop paying yourself to "extend company runway," you're actually just transferring the burn from the company to your personal sanity.

We call this **The Fatal Drift**. It's the period where a founder's personal finances become so stressed that their decision-making capability degrades, just as the company needs them most.

### A Better Way: The True Survival Runway

To get a real pulse on your situation, you need to look at your **Combined Burn**. This is the sum of your business expenses and your personal cost of living. 

By modeling these together, you can see your true "Drop Dead" date. This is the only number that actually matters when deciding when to start your next fundraise.
