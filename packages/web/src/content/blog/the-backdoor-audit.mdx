If you work at Google, Meta, or Microsoft, you've probably heard of the **Mega Backdoor Roth**. 

But for most people, it's just "that complicated thing I'll do later." 

### The Math of Inaction

Most tech workers stop contributing to their 401(k) once they hit the $23,500 employee limit. They then redirect their remaining surplus to a standard taxable brokerage account (like Robinhood or Schwab).

That feels responsible. But it's actually an extremely expensive decision.

### The Taxable vs. Roth Gap

Let's look at the numbers for a 30-year-old software engineer:
*   **The Surplus:** $40,000/year (filling the Mega Backdoor gap).
*   **The Growth:** 7% annual return.
*   **The Timeline:** 30 years.

**In a Taxable Account:** You'll pay capital gains tax every time you rebalance, and a massive tax bill when you retire. After-tax total: **~$3.1M**.

**In a Mega Backdoor Roth:** You pay $0 in capital gains tax. Ever. After-tax total: **~$4.2M**.

**The Cost of Inaction: $1.1 Million.**
