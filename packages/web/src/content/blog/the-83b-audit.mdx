There is a single sheet of paper that defines the tax destiny of every startup founder. 

It's the **Section 83(b) Election**.

### The 30-Day Countdown

The rule is simple but brutal: When you receive unvested stock, you have exactly **30 days** to tell the IRS how you want to be taxed. If you miss that window by 1 day, there is no appeal. No extension. No "oops."

### The "Silent" Tax Bill

If you miss the 83(b) election, you don't owe taxes today. You owe them **as you vest**. 

Imagine you start a company. Your shares are worth $0.0001 today. You vest over 4 years. 
*   **With 83(b):** You pay tax on $0.0001 today (basically $0).
*   **Without 83(b):** In Year 4, your company is worth $100M. You vest $1M worth of stock. You now owe income tax on that $1M—**at a 37% rate**—even if you haven't sold a single share.

This is how founders go bankrupt while "getting rich."
