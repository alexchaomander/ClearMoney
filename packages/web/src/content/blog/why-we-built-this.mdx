# Why We Built This

The personal finance industry has been captured by corporate interests.

The sites and apps that are supposed to help you make better money decisions? Most of them exist to serve banks, credit card issuers, and advertisers—not you. They're paid to push products, inflate valuations, and bury the real math under walls of SEO content.

**We're building something different.**

## The Problem

The average American makes financial decisions based on:

- Influencer recommendations (often paid)
- Affiliate-driven "reviews" disguised as journalism
- Word of mouth from friends who don't know the math
- Marketing from financial institutions themselves
- "Free" advice from companies that profit when you choose wrong

This information asymmetry costs regular people thousands of dollars per year in:

- Annual fees for cards that don't fit their spending
- Suboptimal investment allocations
- Higher interest rates than they could qualify for
- Missed tax deductions and credits
- Products designed to profit from their confusion

## Follow the Money

Let's look at credit cards as an example. The Points Guy was acquired by Red Ventures (now Bankrate) in 2012. Red Ventures is a **$4 billion marketing company** that makes money by driving financial product applications.

TPG earns $200-$500+ per approved credit card application. Higher-fee cards typically pay higher commissions. Their "valuations" make expensive cards look better. Content is optimized for affiliate clicks, not reader value.

**TPG is not a media company—it's a lead generation machine disguised as journalism.**

The same pattern repeats across personal finance:
- "Best savings account" lists ordered by who pays the most
- Investment platforms recommending their own products
- Insurance comparison sites that only show partners
- Budgeting apps selling your financial data

## Our Mission: Financial Literacy for Everyone

We believe everyone deserves access to the same analytical tools and honest information that financial professionals use.

This means:

**Across all of personal finance:**
- Credit cards and rewards optimization
- Banking and high-yield savings
- Investing and retirement planning
- Budgeting and saving strategies
- Debt management and credit building
- Tax planning and optimization

**With these principles:**
- Tools first, not content walls
- Math you can verify
- Opinions that take real stances
- Transparent about how we make money
- Independent from corporate influence

## Our Promise

We're not here to sell you financial products. We're here to help you decide.

**We will never:**
- Recommend a product because of its affiliate payout
- Inflate valuations to make products look better
- Suppress negative reviews of products that pay us
- Accept editorial input from financial institutions
- Hide affiliate relationships from readers
- Prioritize revenue over your outcomes

**We will always:**
- Show our math so you can verify our claims
- Include non-affiliate options when they're better
- Publish negative reviews even if it costs us money
- Disclose exactly how we make money
- Recommend AGAINST products when appropriate
- Admit when we don't know something

## Tools First

People don't want to read 3,000 words to figure out a financial question.

They want to plug in their numbers and get an answer.

That's why we lead with **interactive calculators**—not walls of text. Our tools do the math for you, show their work, and let you adjust the assumptions.

Whether you're trying to figure out:
- Is this credit card worth the annual fee?
- Should I do Roth or Traditional?
- How much should I have in my emergency fund?
- What's the fastest way to pay off my debt?
- Am I saving enough for retirement?

We build tools that answer these questions in minutes, not hours of reading.

## Join Us

We're just getting started. If you believe in honest financial advice and want to help us build something better, here's how:

1. **Use our tools** and tell us how to make them better
2. **Share our content** when you find it helpful
3. **Hold us accountable** if we ever stray from these principles
4. **Suggest topics** where you feel underserved by existing content

The financial advice industry is worth billions. It's time someone built something that serves people, not corporations.
