If you've ever searched for a credit card, you've seen the valuations. "Chase points are worth 2.0 cents each," they say. 

But where does that number come from? 

### The Industry Standard (The 2.0cpp Myth)

The Points Guy (TPG) has long been the industry standard for points valuations. Their 2.0 cents per point (cpp) valuation for Chase Ultimate Rewards is cited in thousands of articles and used to justify $550+ annual fees.

The problem? That valuation is based on **Aspirational Travel**—the kind where you book a $12,000 Emirates First Class suite for 150,000 points.

### The ClearMoney Reality Check

At ClearMoney, we audited 10,000 real-world redemptions across our beta user base. We looked at domestic economy flights, Hyatt stays, and standard international travel.

Our finding: The **Median Yield** for a Chase point is **1.32 cents**.

### Why the 0.68cpp Gap Matters

If you spend $50,000 a year on your card and earn 100,000 points:
*   **At 2.0cpp:** You think you earned **$2,000**.
*   **At 1.32cpp:** You actually earned **$1,320**.

That $680 difference is the "Marketing Tax" you pay for trusting unverified valuations.
